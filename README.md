That's an important clarification! Updating the terminology ensures the documentation accurately reflects your specific hardware setup: a system driven by 2 actuators (likely for X-Y or X-Z motion) and a single load cell sensor (or force sensor).Here is the revised README.md with all references to "6-axis" and "gantry" replaced as requested.🚗 AI-Powered AC Vent Inspection ToolThis project demonstrates an Automated Quality Control (AQC) system using Machine Learning (ML) to inspect the mechanical "feel" and functionality of car AC vent louvers, relying solely on load cell sensor data and actuator position measurements.It is designed to replace subjective human tactile inspection with objective, quantifiable metrics.📌 Key FeaturesObjective Quality Control: Replaces subjective human assessment of "feel" with quantifiable force and torque metrics, collected by the load cell sensor.Actuator-Driven Testing: Precise mechanical interaction with the louver is achieved using the 2 actuator system for controlled movement.Hard Limit Enforcement: Enforces strict engineering limits on activation forces: $F_z \le 4.0 \text{ N}$ (Up/Down) and $F_{xy} \le 6.0 \text{ N}$ (Sideways).ML-Based Soft Limit Check: Uses a classifier (simulated Random Forest) to detect subtle anomalies like grittiness, binding, and excessive friction by analyzing the entire force-displacement curve shape.Streamlit Frontend: Provides a simple, interactive web interface for real-time results, visualizations, and testing various scenarios.⚙️ System Architecture (Simulation)The core logic simulates a production environment where data is collected from industrial hardware and processed at the edge:Data Acquisition: Simulated data streams from a load cell sensor and actuator position sensors ($P_x, P_y, P_z$) are collected at $1000 \text{ Hz}$.Actuator Control: The 2 actuator system executes precise, programmable movements to interact with the AC vent.Feature Engineering: Raw time-series data is converted into actionable features (e.g., peak forces, force variance, smoothness score).Inference: The data is checked against the hard force limits, and then fed to the pre-trained ML model for final quality classification (PASS/FAIL).Presentation: Results and diagnostic plots are displayed immediately via the Streamlit web application.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the interactive application locally.PrerequisitesYou need Python 3.8+ and Git installed on your system.1. Clone the RepositoryClone the project from GitHub and navigate into the directory:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Gantry-Inspection-Tool.git
cd AI-Gantry-Inspection-Tool
2. Set Up Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv) to isolate dependencies:macOS / Linux:Bashpython3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Windows (Command Prompt):Bashpython -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the ApplicationExecute the Streamlit frontend script. This script will automatically create the necessary inspection_model.joblib dummy model on the first run.Bashstreamlit run app_frontend.py
Your web browser should automatically open the AI-Powered AC Vent Inspection Console at http://localhost:8501.🧪 Usage and TestingOnce the app is running, use the controls on the left to simulate different testing scenarios:Test ModeDescriptionExpected AI OutcomePASS (Simulated 1.0N Max)Simulates a good louver with low force and smooth movement.PASSFAIL - Fz Breach (Simulated 5.0N Max)Simulates a stiff louver where vertical force exceeds the 4.0 N limit.FAIL (Hard Limit)FAIL - Fxy Breach (Simulated 7.0N Max)Simulates a sticky louver where sideways force exceeds the 6.0 N limit.FAIL (Hard Limit)The results panel will display the final decision, the reason for failure (Hard Limit or ML-detected Binding), and a plot of the Force vs. Position curve for engineering diagnostics.📝 File StructureFileDescriptionapp_frontend.pyThe main Streamlit application, containing all data acquisition, feature engineering, and prediction logic.requirements.txtLists all necessary Python packages (streamlit, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).inspection_model.joblibThe serialized file containing the dummy trained ML model..gitignoreEnsures development files and large data are not pushed to GitHub.🤝 ContributingThis project is a functional proof-of-concept. Contributions are welcome! Potential future enhancements include:Replacing dummy data acquisition with live hardware API calls.Integrating a real dataset to train a production-grade ML model.Implementing Predictive Maintenance logic for the actuator system itself.📄 LicenseThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
